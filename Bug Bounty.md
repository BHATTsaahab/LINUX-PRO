# Bug Bounty Overview

## Definition
A **Bug Bounty** is a program where organizations **reward individuals** (security researchers or ethical hackers) for **finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities** in their software or systems.

## How It Works
1. **Define Scope & Rules**: Company outlines what systems are in-scope and the rules of engagement.
2. **Security Testing**: Researchers test the systems for vulnerabilities.
3. **Submission**: Vulnerabilities are submitted via a bug bounty platform or direct channel.
4. **Verification**: The company confirms the validity and severity of the report.
5. **Reward**: Bounty is paid based on severity and impact.

## Why Companies Offer Bug Bounties?
- **Improve Security**: Identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for valid findings instead of hiring full-time experts.
- **Community Engagement**: Collaborate with the global ethical hacking community.

## Who Participates?
- **Companies**: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.
- **Platforms**: HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, YesWeHack, etc.
- **Researchers**: Ethical hackers, InfoSec professionals, and enthusiasts.

## Bug Bounty Severity Classification (P1–P5)
Helps prioritize fixing vulnerabilities based on **impact & urgency**:

| **Level**          | **Description**                          | **Impact**                          | **Response**               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **P1 – Critical**  | Easily exploitable, severe vulnerabilities | Full system compromise, major data loss | Immediate fix             |
| **P2 – High**      | Major damage vulnerabilities             | Unauthorized access, service outage | High priority fix         |
| **P3 – Medium**    | Moderate issues, moderately exploitable | Limited data leaks, access control flaws | Patch in regular cycle   |
| **P4 – Low**       | Low-risk, needs specific conditions     | Minor issues, no major harm        | Fix when feasible         |
| **P5 – Info**      | Non-exploitable findings, suggestions   | Informational only                 | Often no fix required     |
